    "The major issue is being unable to produce effective monitoring and treatment technologies for myocardial infarction (MI) survivors. Being able to predict myocardial complications is essential for advancing technologies in this background. MI can occur without complications or with complications that do not worsen the long-term prognosis. However about half of the patients in the acute and subacute periods have complications that lead to worsening of the disease and even death. Predicting complications of myocardial infarction in order to carry out the necessary preventive measures is an important task in order to best serve patients health and lifespan.\n"
